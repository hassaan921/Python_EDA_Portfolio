# Python_EDA_Portfolio

This EDA project was completed using Python in Google Colab. 

## Executive Summary
To identify potential patterns in sales of Aerofit’s three treadmills on offer, the marketing team conducted a consumer analysis of 180 purchases during the last three months of the outgoing quarter. The team found that 88% of customers are in their 20s and 30s. Moreover, there is a positive relationship between income level and treadmill choice, with middle-income customers purchasing KP281 and KP481, whereas KP781 is the sole choice of high-income customers. The choice of treadmill is also linked to customers’ psychographics: the higher the customers rate their fitness level (scale of 1-5), the more likely they are to purchase KP781 (72.5% of customers). There is a significant association among gender and treadmill types. Men are more likely to rate their fitness 5, and consequently, purchase KP781. Considering these key insights, this report makes recommendations for new metrics for data collection, dropping metrics which did not yield actionable insights, tailoring copywriting and advertisement towards specific segments, and collaboration with fitness groups and individuals.
